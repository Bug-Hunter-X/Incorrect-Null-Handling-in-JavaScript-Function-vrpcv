# Incorrect Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript:  improper handling of null or undefined values when performing operations like addition.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The primary issue is a lack of robust null checks in the original code. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if the function receives unexpected input.  The solution emphasizes using comprehensive checks for null or undefined values to prevent potential errors and ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
